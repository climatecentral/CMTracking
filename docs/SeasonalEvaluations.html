<h2>Graphic Popularity by Attribute</h2>
<p>‘Attribute’ is used to describe two characteristics of a graphic: the geographic resolution, and the type of graphic. Graphic popularity is calculated as the number of hits per graphic of that attribute.</p>
<p>Graphic ‘type’ is classified as: chart, map, explainer, gif or other. Graphic ‘geo’ is classified as: local/state, regional, national, global or n/a.</p>

<h2>Graphic Popularity by Attribute</h2>
<p>‘Attribute’ is used to describe two characteristics of a graphic: the geographic resolution, and the type of graphic. Graphic popularity is calculated as the number of hits per graphic of that attribute.</p>
<p>Graphic ‘type’ is classified as: chart, map, explainer, gif or other. Graphic ‘geo’ is classified as: local/state, regional, national, global or n/a.</p>
